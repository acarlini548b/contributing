##Contribution Workflow

###Basic Knowledge
It is much easier to participate and contribute to code if you have the basic knowledge of GitHub and Git. The following resources should help you quickly get started:

- [GitHub Flow (5m Read)][3]
- [Tutorial to understand GitHub (15m)][4]
- [PISquare - GitHub Guidelines][5]

You'll probably need to learn more but at least these resources gives you a starting point.

###Recommended Workflow 
 
- Fork the project
- Create a new branch for your changes
- Open a pull request to inform you have started working on some changes.  This may be a good way to start a discussions and get early feedback, 
- make the changes in the new branch, commit often, discuss with others about changes you are making by using GitHub features.
- When completed, switch to the master branch and sync it to make sure it is up to date
- If the master had changed, merge changes into your new branch to test  everything and make sure your changes work with the latest version.
- You can tell the project owner, by using the discussion of your Pull request, that you have completed your changes and they are ready to be merged.
